Welcome to Class!

## Part 1 Outline

### As you come in:

* Navigate to [nerdyperson.com](http://www.nerdyperson.com) (This webpage)
* Download [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com)
* Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### Class goals
* Transition from web consumer to producer/maker/creator
* Create an interactive web application from scratch using JavaScript
* Review HTML, CSS and build back up to JavaScript

### HTML Tags
* HTML tags are the building blocks of webpages.  Most tags have an opening and closing tag that you can put stuff between (**nesting**).

This is an opening and closing header tag:
```
<h1> </h1>
```

We can put text between the tags to make a header for our webpage:  
```
<h1> Welcome to my Site </h1>
```

Experiment with some other tags: What do they do?
```
<h1> </h1>
<h2> </h2>
<h3> </h3>
<strong> </strong>
<em> </em>
<p> </p>
```

Some tags only have one component. They open and close themselves at the same time. What do these do?
```
<br />
<hr />
```

### Adding attributes to tags
You can add properties and data called **attributes** to further customize some tags.  Attributes have keys and values.  The key is the name of the attribute, and the value is the data connected to that attribute. Here's a tag to add an image to your webpage:
```
<img> </img>
```

We need to pass an image source (src) to the tag so it can render an actual picture:

```
<img src="mypicture.png"> </img>
```

If you find an image you like, right click and select "Copy image address".  This will copy the source/location of your image for you.

‚ö†Ô∏è üö® **Be careful with formatting!  Watch for opening and closing carets and quotation marks!**

Here's how to create a link using the **anchor** tag and the **href** attribute.

```
<a href="http://www.google.com">Link to Google</a>
```

### Nesting HTML Tags
You've already nested text nodes inside of HTML tags.  Now let's try nesting some HTML tags inside of other tags!

These tags in combination make make an unordered list.  Notice how the ```<li>``` tags are ***nested*** inside the outside ```<ul>``` tags:
```
<ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Quinoa</li>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
<ul>
```

Here's an ordered list:
```
<ol>
    <li>preheat oven</li>
    <li>mix ingredients</li>
    <li>bake cake</li>
</ol>
```

### HTML Document
Here's your canvas for doing further work.  We're going to build most of the webpage inside of the ```<body>``` tags:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <style></style>
    </head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Move your work so far in between the opening and closing ```<body>``` tags.  Don't forget to give your webpage a title in the ```<title>``` section!  (You'll see that title render in the top of your browser tab).

### Styling with CSS
We might want to further customize our HTML tags.  We can do that in the ```<style>``` section of our document:

Here's how we can change the properties of all the paragraph, ```<p>``` tags on our webpage.  This is called a **CSS selector** because it **selects** a part of the page we want to target for styling.

```
p{

}
```

Now we can add some properties:
```
p{
    color: green;
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è üö® **Be careful with formatting!  Watch for opening and closing brackets and make sure every line ends with a semicolon!**

Experiment with more properties on your own:

```
p{
    color: green;
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Try targeting another tag like a header:
```
h1{
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
```

What happens if you have multiple ```<p>``` tags on a page?  How do the tags get affected by your styles?

Experiment with more properties:
```
padding: 10px;
margin: 50px;
border: 3px solid black;
border-radius: 80%;
```

### Styling with classes

Sometimes we don't want to target all of our tags of the same time for styling.  We can use a ***class*** to target specific pieces of the page.  
We can add a class attribute to any HTML tag:

Here's our example webpage.  
```
<p>My first paragraph!</p>
<p>My second paragraph!</p>
<p>My third paragraph!</p>

```

If I want to make the ONLY the second paragraph background red with white font, I could write a CSS class selector like this.  I have to give my class selector a name.  In this case, I called it "myStyle".  You can name your classes anything you want as long as you don't use any spaces.  

```
.myStyle{
    background: red;
    color: white;
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è üö® **Be careful with formatting! Classes start with a period! Your style name cannot have any spaces in it!**

Now I have to apply my style class to the second paragraph.  I use the class attribute to lay the style into the page:

```
<p>My first paragraph!</p>
<p class="myStyle">My second paragraph!</p>
<p>My third paragraph!</p>

```

### Stretch project:
* Do a search for ```CSS Flexbox```.  See if you can use this to position a ```<div>``` in interesting ways on your webpage.
